The rain whispered softly against the quiet streets, painting the evening with reflections of glowing streetlights. Somewhere in the distance, a train horn echoed like a lonely memory drifting through the night. People hurried past with stories in their pockets, dreams in their eyes, and warmth in their hands. The city breathed slowly, alive in its own silent rhythm, waiting for tomorrow to begin.
